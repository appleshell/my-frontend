### MVC
MVC is a software design pattern for organizing application code into three interwoven parts: a model, controller, view.
  - The model is the logic for interacting with the database;
  - The view is the user interfaces users interact;
  - The controller is the intermediary between the model and view.
  
The MVC aims to divide code into units of their own. This is popularly called **separation of concerns**.
